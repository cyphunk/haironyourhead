# HealthMonitor
Heart rate and GSR monitor based on ESP8266-12E.
Work in progress.

Heart rate sensor - https://www.seeedstudio.com/Grove-Finger-clip-Heart-Rate-Sensor-with-shell-p-2420.html
GSR sensor - https://www.seeedstudio.com/Grove-GSR-sensor-p-1614.html

ESP measures GSR via AD and sends the value over OSC so far.
Needs tiding up and optimizing.
Add heart rate over I2C
